# About Me

When I was 6, my childish curiosity led me to take apart my Buzz Lightyear toy. Eventually, I was able to put it back together. When I was 14, I received my first computer. Eventually, I was able to put that back together, too. Whether it's cloud computing, WiFi, or customer service: this child-like curiosity pushes me to learn more.

Now, with 8 years of experience in IT, I've found joy in designing and implementing IT solutions that empower business, enhance workplace experience, and reduce operational cost.
