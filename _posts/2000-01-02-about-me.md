# About Me

When I was 6 I had a Buzz Lightyear toy, complete with laser beams and sound effects. My childish curiosity led me to take it apart. I destroyed that toy, but I learned a lot. When I was 14, I received my first computer. Eventually, I was able to take it apart *and* put it back together.

Now, with 8 years of experience in IT, I've found joy in designing and implementing IT solutions that empower business, enhance workplace experience, and reduce operational cost.
